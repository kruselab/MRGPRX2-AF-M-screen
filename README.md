# MRGPRX2-AF-M-screen
This repository contains code used to perform the virtual screen described in Harvey _et al._ 2025 (currently unpublished). AlphaFold-Multimer (version 3) outputs can be parsed and scored using the `run_pipeline()` command found in scoring.R. Functions related to the assessment of individual features' predictive ability can be found in evaluation.R.
